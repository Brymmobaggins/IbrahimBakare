## Useful resources

- [fontawesome](https://www.Fontawesome.com) - I wanted to integrate dark/light mode features on the navigation bar, which was a bit confusing. It enables to get the accurate icons for this project. I had to navigate to fontawesome.com and type "toggle" on search bar, it pops up the attribute of the icon "<i class="fa fa-moon"></i>". It was really helpful and amazing.
  
- [Googlefonts](https://www.Googlefonts.com) - This resources was very useful and important, i was stuck in the middle. I have being indecisive lately in choosing fonts and accurate colors. I have finally found "Font-font-family:Press Start 2P" which looks or more or less like Supermario game font, lol. it was lovely though. I love the fact that it looks irregular.
