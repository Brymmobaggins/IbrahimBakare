## Useful resources

- [fontawesome](https://www.Fontawesome.com) - I wanted to integrate dark/light mode features on the navigation bar, which was a bit confusing. It enables me to get accurate icons for this project. I had to navigate to fontawesome.com to type "toggle" on search bar, it pops up the attribute of the icon "<i class="fa fa-moon"></i>". It was helpful and amazing.
  
- [Googlefonts](https://www.Googlefonts.com) - These resources had been very necessary,I got confusedd in the middle. I have been indecisive lately in choosing fonts and accurate colors. I finally found "Font-font-family: Press Start 2P" which looks or more or less like Supermario game font, lol. It was lovely, though. I love the fact that it looked irregular.
